I chime in with a
Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality
But this ain't that song
And this ain't that band
And this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I am an arms dealer fitting you with
Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
As long as the room keeps singing
That's just the business I'm in
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on
But I digress
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh so intricate, yeah
I wrote the gospel on giving up
Look pretty sinking
But the real bombshells have already sunk

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full
Please catch another
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
So intricate
I'm a leading man
Lies I weave are oh so intricate
So intricate
Yeah
Woah, oh, woah oh, oh, oh
All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move
Fast enough
Sing 'til your lungs give out
'Cause this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Now you)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Sing it out loud)
(This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race)
(This ain't a scene) Oh
It's a goddamn arms race
I'm a leading man
The lies I weave are oh so intricate
So intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
So intricate
